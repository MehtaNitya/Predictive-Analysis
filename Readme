💇‍♀️ Hair Fall Risk Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting hair fall risk using machine learning techniques based on lifestyle, health, and personal factors.
The system classifies individuals into Low Risk or High Risk categories and also performs user segmentation using clustering.

The project includes:

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Supervised machine learning models

Model evaluation using multiple metrics

Clustering for user segmentation

Risk scoring visualization

🎯 Objectives

Identify key factors contributing to hair fall

Build and compare multiple ML classification models

Predict hair fall risk (Low / High)

Segment users using clustering techniques

Visualize correlations, performance metrics, and risk scores

🛠 Technologies & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data handling

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine Learning models


📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains personal and lifestyle attributes such as:

Age

Gender

Family History

Dandruff

Sleep Hours

Stress Level

Gut Issues

Energy Levels

Supplements

Hair Fall Count

Hair Fall Duration

Wash Frequency

Iron Levels

🎯 Target Variable

Risk_Target

0 → Low Hair Fall Risk

1 → High Hair Fall Risk

🔍 Data Preprocessing

Renamed columns for clarity

Handled inconsistent target labels

Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding

Scaled features using StandardScaler

Removed unmapped or invalid rows

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature importance analysis using Random Forest

Correlation matrix to identify relationships between features

Visualization of key influencing factors

🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

The following supervised learning models were trained and evaluated:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree

Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Random Forest

📏 Model Evaluation Metrics

Each model was evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Confusion Matrix (Best Model)

The best-performing model was selected based on accuracy.

👥 Clustering (User Segmentation)

K-Means Clustering was applied

Users were grouped into 3 clusters based on similarities

Helps identify different hair-fall behavior patterns

⚠ Risk Scoring System

Risk probability predicted using the best model

Converted probabilities into Risk Scores (0–100)

Visualized score distribution with threshold marking

Helps interpret model predictions easily
